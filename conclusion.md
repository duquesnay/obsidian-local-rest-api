# Project Conclusion: Obsidian Local REST API Enhancement

## Project Summary
Enhanced the Obsidian Local REST API plugin to add file rename functionality via PATCH endpoint, along with comprehensive development tooling and documentation.

## Timeline of Major Milestones

1. **Initial Setup & Environment Analysis**
   - Established development environment with hot reload support
   - Created launcher scripts for Obsidian with logging capabilities
   - Discovered and documented hot reload limitations

2. **Feature Implementation: File Rename**
   - Implemented PATCH /vault/{filepath} endpoint for file renaming
   - Added proper validation and error handling
   - Integrated with Obsidian's FileManager API for link preservation

3. **Development Tooling Creation**
   - Built comprehensive script suite (dev-watch.sh, obsidian-launcher.sh)
   - Created debugging utilities for plugin reload
   - Developed automated test scripts for API validation

4. **Documentation & Knowledge Capture**
   - Created detailed CLAUDE.md for project guidance
   - Documented hot reload workarounds and debugging strategies
   - Built spike documents for complex investigations

## Final Outcomes vs Initial Goals

### Achieved:
✅ File rename endpoint implementation with proper API contract
✅ Comprehensive development environment setup
✅ Automated testing and debugging tools
✅ Detailed documentation for future development

### Challenges Overcome:
- Hot reload plugin not detecting file changes automatically
- **Obsidian cache loading backup versions instead of edited files**
- Console logs during plugin startup not being captured
- Complex route ordering issues in Express.js
- OpenAPI validation constraints with markdown-patch library

## What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Approach**: Creating dedicated scripts for each development task
2. **Documentation-First**: Building CLAUDE.md as we discovered patterns
3. **Spike Methodology**: Using focused investigations for complex problems
4. **Test Automation**: Shell scripts for API testing avoided permission issues

## What Could Be Improved

1. **Hot Reload Integration**: Still requires manual intervention
2. **Logging Architecture**: Plugin startup logs remain inaccessible
3. **Testing Framework**: Could benefit from proper Jest integration
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: No automated testing on commits
