# Parallel Work Architecture: The Architect Agent Pattern

## Overview

As we scale parallel development with multiple Claude agents using git worktrees, we introduce an **Architect Agent** role that monitors for architectural issues revealed by coordination conflicts and transforms them into modularization opportunities.

## The Architect Agent Role

### Purpose
Instead of just coordinating conflicts between agents, the Architect Agent identifies when conflicts indicate poor modularity and guides refactoring to enable truly parallel work.

### Responsibilities
1. **Monitor Conflict Patterns**
   - Track which files cause repeated conflicts
   - Identify hotspots where multiple agents converge
   - Analyze coupling that prevents parallel work

2. **Diagnose Architectural Issues**
   - Large files attracting many changes
   - Tight coupling between unrelated features
   - Missing abstractions or interfaces
   - Violation of single responsibility principle

3. **Design Modular Solutions**
   - Propose file/module splits
   - Define clear interfaces
   - Create proper boundaries
   - Establish ownership models

4. **Coordinate Refactoring**
   - Pause feature work when needed
   - Guide agents through refactoring
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Resume parallel work post-refactoring

## Detection Patterns

### Red Flags for Architect Intervention

1. **File Conflict Frequency**
   ```
   If file X has conflicts in > 30% of agent merges → Needs splitting
   ```

2. **Multi-Agent Bottlenecks**
   ```
   If > 2 agents need to modify same file → Review modularity
   ```

3. **Large File Syndrome**
   ```
   If file > 500 lines AND multiple agents need it → Decompose
   ```

4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   ```
   If agents add similar patterns to different files → Extract abstraction
   ```

## Intervention Process

### 1. Detection Phase
```markdown
## Conflict Analysis Report
- requestHandler.ts: 5 conflicts this week
- Agents involved: agent-1 (move), agent-2 (batch), agent-3 (webhooks)
- Pattern: All adding new endpoint handlers
- Diagnosis: Monolithic handler file
```

### 2. Design Phase
```markdown
## Proposed Refactoring
FROM: src/requestHandler.ts (1371 lines)
TO:
  - src/handlers/base.ts (abstract handler)
  - src/handlers/file-operations.ts (move, rename, delete)
  - src/handlers/batch-operations.ts (batch endpoints)
  - src/handlers/webhooks.ts (webhook endpoints)
  - src/handlers/index.ts (composition root)
```

### 3. Coordination Phase
```markdown
## Refactoring Plan
1. All agents: Pause feature work
2. Architect: Create base abstractions
3. Agent-1: Extract file operations
4. Agent-2: Extract batch operations  
5. Agent-3: Extract webhook handlers
6. All: Resume feature work in isolation
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Request Handler Conflicts

**Problem**: Three agents all modifying requestHandler.ts
```typescript
// requestHandler.ts - 1300+ lines
class RequestHandler {
  // Agent 1 wants to add:
  handleRenameOperation() { }
  
  // Agent 2 wants to add:
  handleBatchOperation() { }
  
  // Agent 3 wants to add:
  handleWebhookRegistration() { }
}
```

**Architect Solution**:
```typescript
// handlers/file-operations.ts (Agent 1 owns)
export class FileOperationHandler extends BaseHandler {
  handleRename() { }
  handleMove() { }
}

// handlers/batch-operations.ts (Agent 2 owns)
export class BatchOperationHandler extends BaseHandler {
  handleBatch() { }
}

// handlers/webhooks.ts (Agent 3 owns)
export class WebhookHandler extends BaseHandler {
  handleRegistration() { }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Type Definition Bottleneck

**Problem**: types.ts becomes a bottleneck
```typescript
// types.ts - everyone needs to add types here
export interface FileOperation { } // Agent 1
export interface BatchRequest { }  // Agent 2
export interface WebhookConfig { } // Agent 3
```

**Architect Solution**:
```typescript
// types/file-operations.ts
export interface FileOperation { }

// types/batch.ts  
export interface BatchRequest { }

// types/webhooks.ts
export interface WebhookConfig { }

// types/index.ts - re-exports for compatibility
export * from './file-operations';
export * from './batch';
export * from './webhooks';
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual Architect (Current)
- Human identifies patterns
- Coordinates refactoring manually
- Learns what patterns emerge

### Phase 2: Assisted Architect
- Scripts detect conflict frequency
- Suggest refactoring candidates
- Semi-automated coordination

### Phase 3: AI Architect Agent
- Claude agent dedicated to architecture
- Monitors git logs and conflicts
- Proposes and coordinates refactoring
- Continuous architecture improvement

## Benefits

1. **Conflicts → Improvements**
   - Each conflict improves architecture
   - System gets better over time
   - Technical debt reduced continuously

2. **True Parallelism**
   - Agents own modules
   - Minimal coordination needed
   - Higher development velocity

3. **Emergent Architecture**
   - Structure emerges from actual needs
   - Not over-engineered upfront
   - Pragmatic modularization

4. **Learning System**
   - Patterns documented
   - Best practices emerge
   - Architecture evolves with needs

## Success Metrics

- Conflict frequency per file (should decrease)
- Average merge complexity (should decrease)
- Agent velocity (should increase)
- Code modularity scores (should improve)

## Next Steps

1. Start tracking conflict patterns in WORKTREE-STATUS.md
2. Document recurring conflicts
3. Identify first refactoring candidate
4. Test architect intervention process
5. Refine based on results
