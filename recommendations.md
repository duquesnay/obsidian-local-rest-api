# Recommendations for CLAUDE.md Updates

## Proposed Additions to Parent CLAUDE.md Files

### 1. For Global CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

#### Add to "Claude Code Permission Workarounds" section:

```markdown
### Complex Command Pattern
When working with commands that include pipes, redirects, or multiple operators:

1. **Create reusable shell scripts** instead of inline commands
2. **For one-time tasks**, reuse existing scripts with different arguments
3. **Benefits**:
   - Avoids repeated permission prompts
   - Makes commands more maintainable
   - Enables complex command chains

Example transformation:
```bash
# Instead of:
curl -k https://api.example.com | jq '.data[]' | grep pattern

# Create script:
#!/bin/bash
# api-query.sh
curl -k "$1" > /tmp/api-result.json
jq "$2" /tmp/api-result.json | grep "$3"
```
```

#### Add to "Development Workflow" section:

```markdown
### Plugin Development Patterns

#### Hot Reload Troubleshooting
1. Hot reload plugins often fail to detect changes automatically
2. Always implement manual reload mechanisms:
   - Command palette triggers
   - API endpoints for reload
   - Developer console scripts
3. Document reload methods in project CLAUDE.md

#### Console Logging in Electron Apps
- Startup logs (constructor, onload) may not appear in standard output
- Use Developer Console for debugging initialization
- Only runtime logs appear in file logs
```

### 2. For Project-Level CLAUDE.md (`/Users/guillaume/Dev/tools/mcp-obsidian/CLAUDE.md`)

#### Add to "Common Development Tasks" section:

```markdown
### Handling Route-Based API Changes
When adding new endpoints that conflict with wildcards:
1. Check route ordering - specific routes must come before wildcards
2. Test with curl to verify route matching
3. Consider middleware ordering for validation bypass

### Shell Script Development Pattern
Create scripts in `scripts/` directory for:
- Development workflows (`dev/`)
- Testing routines (`test/`)
- Debugging utilities (`debug/`)

This avoids Claude Code permission issues and provides reusable tools.
```

### 3. For Technology-Specific Guidelines

#### Add new section "Obsidian Plugin Development":

```markdown
### Obsidian Plugin Development

**Key Patterns**:
- Always use `app.fileManager` API for file operations
- Plugin reload requires disable/enable cycle
- Hot reload requires manual triggering
- Developer Console (Cmd+Option+I) essential for debugging

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
cp main.js /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/plugin-name/

# Reload (in Developer Console)
await app.plugins.disablePlugin('plugin-name');
await app.plugins.enablePlugin('plugin-name');
```

**Common Pitfalls**:
- Console logs during plugin startup not captured
- File watchers may not detect direct file writes
- Route validation can block custom endpoints
```

## Workflow Improvements

### New Workflow Command Suggestion

Add to "Custom Workflow Memory":
```markdown
- create dev scripts = analyze repetitive commands, create shell scripts in scripts/ directory
- debug electron = check Developer Console first, then file logs, then verbose logging
- test api endpoint = create/reuse test script instead of inline curl commands
```

## Configuration Improvements

### Development Environment Setup
Recommend adding to project setup:
```markdown
## First Time Setup
1. Create `scripts/` directory structure:
   - `scripts/dev/` - Development utilities
   - `scripts/test/` - Test harnesses  
   - `scripts/debug/` - Debugging tools

2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/**/*.sh
   ```

3. Add to .gitignore:
   ```
   *.log
   /tmp/
   .env
   ```
```

## Tools and Practices to Adopt Globally

1. **fswatch** - File system monitoring for development watchers
2. **Script-first approach** - Create scripts before complex commands
3. **Spike documentation** - Document investigations as they happen
4. **Explicit reload mechanisms** - Never rely solely on automatic reload
5. **Test scripts over inline commands** - Prevents permission fatigue

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Adopt Immediately):
1. Add shell script pattern to global CLAUDE.md
2. Document Electron/plugin console logging behavior
3. Include hot reload troubleshooting guide

### Medium Priority (Consider for Next Update):
1. Create template scripts directory structure
2. Add Obsidian-specific development section
3. Document route ordering pitfalls

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements):
1. Automated script generation workflow
2. Permission workaround automation
3. Cross-project learning integration
