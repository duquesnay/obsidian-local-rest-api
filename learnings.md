# Technical Learnings: Obsidian Local REST API

## Technical Insights

### Obsidian Plugin Development
1. **Hot Reload Limitations**
   - Hot Reload plugin doesn't detect file changes automatically
   - Requires manual trigger via Command Palette or API call
   - File watchers in the plugin seem to have issues with direct file writes
   - **CRITICAL: Obsidian may cache plugin backups in its cache folders**
   - Hot reload may load cached backup versions instead of your edited files
   - Clear Obsidian cache if hot reload loads old versions

2. **Console Logging Behavior**
   - Plugin startup logs (constructor, onload) are NOT captured by Electron
   - Only runtime logs after plugin initialization appear
   - Use Developer Console (Cmd+Option+I) for debugging startup issues

3. **Plugin Lifecycle**
   - Plugins require full disable/enable cycle for true reload
   - Simply copying files doesn't trigger reload
   - FileManager API must be used for proper Obsidian integration

### Express.js Route Handling
1. **Route Order Matters**
   - Wildcard routes (`/vault/*`) catch everything before specific routes
   - Place specific routes BEFORE general wildcards
   - Use route-specific middleware for validation bypassing

2. **Validation Constraints**
   - OpenAPI validation can block custom extensions
   - Handle special cases BEFORE validation middleware
   - Early returns prevent downstream validation errors

### Development Environment
1. **Electron Logging**
   - Use `--enable-logging --v=1` for console output
   - Higher verbosity levels create noise without benefit
   - Separate log streams for different components

2. **Shell Script Benefits**
   - Avoids Claude Code permission prompt issues
   - Enables complex piped commands
   - Provides reusable development workflows

## Process Improvements Discovered

1. **Script-First Development**
   - Create shell scripts for repetitive tasks
   - Document scripts with clear purposes
   - Use scripts to avoid permission fatigue

2. **Spike Documentation**
   - Document investigations as they happen
   - Create focused spike documents for complex problems
   - Reference spikes in main documentation

3. **Test Automation Strategy**
   - Shell scripts for API testing work well
   - Separate test scripts by functionality
   - Include cleanup scripts for test artifacts

## Reusable Code Patterns

### Plugin Reload Pattern
```javascript
async function reloadPlugin(pluginId) {
    const plugin = app.plugins.plugins[pluginId];
    if (plugin) {
        await app.plugins.disablePlugin(pluginId);
        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 100));
        await app.plugins.enablePlugin(pluginId);
        new Notice('Plugin reloaded!');
    }
}
```

### File Operation Validation Bypass
```typescript
// Handle special operations before standard validation
if (req.get('Target-Type') === 'file' && req.get('Operation') === 'replace') {
    // Handle file operations
    return handleFileOperation(req, res);
}
// Continue with standard validation
```

### Development Launcher Pattern
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Launcher with proper logging and process management
LOG_DIR="$HOME/Library/Logs/MyApp"
mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"
exec /Applications/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp \
    --enable-logging \
    --v=1 \
    >> "$LOG_DIR/app.log" 2>&1
```

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't Rely on Automatic Hot Reload**
   - Always have manual reload methods ready
   - Test reload mechanisms early in development
   - **Obsidian cache can interfere - it may reload cached backups**
   - If seeing old code after reload, check Obsidian's cache folders

2. **Don't Assume Console Logs Work**
   - Plugin startup logs won't appear in Electron logs
   - Use Developer Console for debugging

3. **Don't Fight the Framework**
   - Work with Express route ordering
   - Handle special cases before validation
   - Use existing APIs (FileManager) instead of direct file ops

4. **Don't Create Inline Complex Commands**
   - Shell scripts prevent permission prompt fatigue
   - Reusable scripts are better than one-off commands

## Dependencies Worth Remembering

- **fswatch**: File system watcher for dev-watch.sh
- **jq**: JSON processing in test scripts
- **curl with -k**: For self-signed certificate APIs
- **Obsidian Developer Console**: Cmd+Option+I for debugging
